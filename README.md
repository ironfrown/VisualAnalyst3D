# VisualAnalyst3D
Open project folder in Unity to build and run. 
When building the project (i.e. creating an executable file), you must copy the folder 'Heightmaps' 
from the Assets folder into the build folder 'VisualAnalyst3D_Data'. This must be done since the
program uses this folder to load and store heightmaps and colormaps as well as raw data.
